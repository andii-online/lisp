# A custom Lisp Interpreter in Rust

Definitely needs a creative name, but for now this is fine. This project is intended to 
help me get better at writing Rust, but is also a dip into the world of programmming languages.

## Parsing

Uses [pest](https://github.com/pest-parser/pest) parser and a custom grammar found in src/grammar.pest.
